1.   oops stands for 
      object oriented programming language. 
2.polymorphism: 
	The ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
	It helps the programmer to reuse the code.abstract
Types:
	* compile time polymorphism:
		If same argument is passed in two methods ,compile time error will be araise.
	* method overloading:
		The same class ,same method with different argument.It is static binding. 
	* method overriding:
		.The different class,same method with different argument.abstract
		.It is dynamic binding and runtime compliationn
	
3.Interface:
	Interface is a design which has unimplement methods ends with semicolon and  we cannot creat a object
	only two access modifier can use in interface ,they are
	  * public
	  * default
Ex in selenium:
	chromeDriver extends chromiumDriver
	chromiumDriver extends remoteWebDriver
Ex in Java:
	arrayList extend abstractList
	abstractList extends abstractCollection
4.Abstract class:
	* Essential to providing an absraction to the code to make it reusable and extendable
	* It has partially impement and unimplement methods
	* Absract is a keyword used for future use 
Ex: abstract class Car{...}
5. * Multiple inheritance:
	 Is when a class inherits from many base classes .
	 Multiple inheritance is possible in interface.
	* Multilevel inheritance:
		Is when a class inherits from a derived class making that derived class a base class for a new class
		Multilevel inheritance is possible in class level.
6.
No ,multiple inheritance	is not possible in java .
7. Inhertiance keyword:
     extends is the keyword for using inheritance
8.keyword to connect interface and class:
	implements is the keyword to connect interface and class.
9.class:
	* A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object.
	* A class may contain abstract methods ,concrete methods.
	members of class can be public ,private,protected or default.
Interface:
	* An interface contains behaviors that class implements.
	* An interface contains only abstact methods.
	* All the members of interface are public by default.
10 Class:
	* class can declared as final.
	* class method can have body.
	Abstract class :
		* Abstract class can have static fields and static methods ,like other classes.
		* Abstract method cannot have body
